Hi, I am Batuhan. I and my friends are done a website project. 
We found a textile company as a real customer.
Our main purpose was to use agile(scrum) methodology and work with real customers.
So, we have gained real-life experiences.
This was our first agile project. Maybe it is not full-correct but we learn a lot of things.
I was not in the developer team, but I tried to help our team in management processes.

For agile methodology;  we used the Jira,  Slack tools and started with plans.
We made a few meetings on MicrosoftTeams and Google Meetings every week and planned sprints.
We were in constant communication with the customer during the development process for the customer's wishes.
The customer gave feedbacks of course.
On the documentation side; Feasibility Report, TestCases, Analyze Reports, and Weekly Excels are done.
